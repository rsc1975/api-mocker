# api-mockr

Just another API mocker that can be configured to response random and specific data. It can help testing integrations with third parties.

Currently, only REST API responses are supported.

# Getting started

This is a NodeJS application, you can install it as dev dependency in your project or as independent project, there is also a [Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/dvlprtech/api-mockr).

## Installation

Installation as dev dependency:

```sh
npm install --save-dev api-mockr
```	

Installation as docker image:

```sh
docker pull dvlprtech/api-mockr
```

For further details about the use with docker you can access to DockerHub [api-mockr image](https://hub.docker.com/r/dvlprtech/api-mockr) page.

## How to use

You can use the CLI tool `api-mockr` to start the application:

```sh
npx api-mockr
```

The following output will apear:

```
Server running at: http://0.0.0.0:3003
```

There are several options params that can be used to configure the server:

* `--port`: The port to listen to. Default is `3003`.
* `--host`: The host to listen to. Default is `0.0.0.0`.
* `--config`: The path to the config file. It's a multivalue param.
* `--apiPrefix`: The prefix to invoque the API services. Default is `/`.

Example of use:
    
```sh
$ npx api-mockr --port=13003 --host=localhost --apiPrefix=/api
Server running at: http://localhost:13003/api
```

Without additional configuration, the default server will response with the following data to whatever request:

```txt
$ curl 'http://localhost:3003/api/whatever?foo=bar'
{"success":true,"request":{"path":"/api/whatever","params":{"foo":"bar"}}}
```

There is an exception, the call to `/` will return a fixed text, that can be used to "ping" the server.
```txt
$ curl 'http://localhost:3003/'
API Mockr
```

## Special params

There are some special params that can be used with each request:

* `_pretty`: If it's set to `true`, the response will be pretty printed.
* `_delay`: The delay in milliseconds to wait before responding.
* `_forceError`: If it's set to `true`, the response will be an error with a http status code of `500` by default.

The error response can be customized with 2 header:

* `x-mocker-force-error'`: HTTP status code to be returned, can be any value between `400` and `599`. Values out of range will be ignored.
* `x-mocker-error-msg`: The error message to be returned, you can use variables in the message, like `"ERROR: ${random.emoji} ${random.phrase}"`.

Example of error response:

```txt
$ curl 'http://localhost:3003/api/whatever?foo=bar&_forceError=true&_pretty=1'
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Error in request to path: /api/whatever",
  "request": {
    "body": null,
    "params": {
      "foo": "bar",
      "_forceError": "true",
      "_pretty": "1"
    }
  }
}
```

Customizing the message and code:

```txt
$ curl -H "x-mocker-force-error: 418" -H 'x-mocker-error-msg: ERROR: ${random.emoji} ${random.phrase}' 'http://localhost:3003/api/whatever?foo=bar&_forceError=true&_pretty=1'
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "ERROR: üê≠ You cant quantify the driver without transmitting the multi-byte SQL microchip!",
  "request": {
    "body": null,
    "params": {
      "foo": "bar",
      "_forceError": "true",
      "_pretty": "1"
    }
  }
```

The emoji and the error phrase will be different with each call.

## Server configuration

The config files can be read in YAML and JSON formats, the default config file is like this:

```yaml
defaultResponse:
  success: true
  request:
    path: ${request.path} 
    body: ${request.payload}
    params: ${request.params}
errorResponse:
  $httpStatus$: 500
  success: false
  error: "${error}"
  request:
    body: ${request.payload}
    params: ${request.params}
routes:
  "*": # HTTP Method
    "*": # Path
      success: true 
      request: 
        path: ${request.path}         
        params: ${request.params}
```

There are 3 main sections in the config file:

* `defaultResponse`: The default response to be returned when there is no match for the request path and the configured routes
* `errorResponse`: The error response payload to be returned when an error occurs.
* `routes`: The routes to be mocked grouped by HTTP method (get, post, put, ...). A wildcard can be used to match any method and/or any path.
